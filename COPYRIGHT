    Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software and its

    and understandings:

      1) Any copy of this software or any copy of software derived
         from it must include this copyright notice in full.

      2) All materials or software developed as a consequence of the
         use of this software or software derived from it must duly
         acknowledge such use, in accordance with the usual standards
         of acknowledging credit in academic research.

         The latest version of the software may be obtained at:

      3) The software may be used by anyone for any purpose, subject to the 
      	Free Software Foundation's General Public License, a copy of which 
         should have been included with this distribution (see the file
         COPYING in the source distribution).
         If it was not included with this distribution, a copy may be obtained

         Those persons or organizations wanting to use code derived from tacg
         in proprietary applications so as not to have their code 'infected'
         by the FSF GPL have the option to license the code directly from from
         the author under a separate license.  This option takes advantage of
         the  so-called Dual Licensing policy, which is approved by the FSF.

      4) This software is not meant to be used as a sole tool to design 
         recombinant molecules for theraputic use.  While it is accurate to
         the best of my knowledge about the results it gives, it has not  
         been validated to this stringency yet.  Hence the release of the 
         source code.

      5) This software is provided AS IS with NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND.  The
         author shall have no liability with respect to the infringement of
         copyrights, trade secrets or any patents by this software or any part
         thereof.  In no event will the author be liable for any lost revenue
         or profits or other special, indirect and consequential damages.

		Inclusion of other software
      ===========================
      
      This software uses code from other authors and packages that are
      copyright  of the individual authors.  Their release policies are not in
      conflict with  those of the GPL, as far as I can tell.  The externally
      developed code is described below.

      The use of the included code does not imply an endorsement of the tacg
      package by the individual authors.
      
      This software uses the SEQIO package for reading and writing sequences.

      the file 'seqio.c' for his release policy.

      This software uses the 'strsep' routines, Copyright (c) 1998 by Gray
      Watson. See the file 'strsep.c' for his release policy.  See also 
      
      This software links to the pcre (Perl-compatible Regular Expression) library,
      written by Phil Hazel, Copyright (c) 1997-2003 University of Cambridge.  See 
      also http://pcre.org.
