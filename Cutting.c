/* Cutting the Sequence, using SHKey/shortcut approach.....  The shortcut is to hash the
   sequence hexamer only once and then use the calculated values of the hexamer to assist in
   calculating the next hash key.  Since 5 of the 6 characters have already been 'hashed' for
   the next key, why recalculate them and suffer the overhead of a function call, when you can
   (with just a little extra code) get the same value on the fly, inline....  It appears to be
   about 5-7x times faster for long sequences (where the cost is in the rehashing, not the base
   cost of hashing the RE data twice.  Surprisingly enough, this is the same approach (albeit
   implemented less elegantly) used in Udi Manber's latest approximate string matching, as well
   as BLAST.   */
